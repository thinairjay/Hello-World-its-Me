The Thin Air DevCo
What is this, you ask...., I would tell ya if I knew...., but one great idea is a Investment GradeCar Registry..., is there a way to decentralize this, especially with the potential for no more 1031 exchange & being able to have a corp with broker license somehow own vehicles?
I think the potential is great, I just wonder if this is ahead of its time for the older collector & using new Tech?
Probably ned to market this to new Internet Millionares, who are young enough to embrace new tech, and jackasses enough to have enough Fuk You Money to get in the high end, colletor car
Sure would be cool project to work on, and think of the fringe benifits, Love it
